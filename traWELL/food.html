                <h2>Ceylon Spices</h2>
                <p>From ancient times, herbs and spices have had a significant impact on Eastern cuisine. Spices enhance a dish's flavor and aroma. Herbs and spices are now appreciated for uses other than flavoring and are in high demand for a variety of therapeutic purposes.
                <br><br>
                Sri Lanka, as the name, 'Spice Island' indicates, is no stranger to the world of herbs and spices. In reality, it is not an exaggeration to say that spices, with their diverse flavor profiles and aromatic characteristics, have affected local cuisine and taste buds.</p>

                <p>A much awaited time of the year in Sri Lanka, the “Aluth Avurudda or Puthandu” is celebrated in many households mainly Buddhist and Hindu as the sun moves from Pisces to Aries marking the end of the harvest season.
                <br><br>
                Sweet meats and special dishes are an important part of the Sinhala and Tamil New Year celebrations.

This time of year, here are several delicious meats and other dishes served in Buddhist and Hindu families. They include Milk rice (kiribath), keum, kokis, aasmi, aluwa,halapa and many more.

                <h2>Traditional Main Courses</h2>
                <p>Sri Lankan rice and curry, the country's national meal, consisting of steaming hot, fluffy rice served with a variety of side dishes known as curries (fish or meat, a gravy or hodda with spices and coconut milk, mallum (chopped leaves with coconut), and fried crispy delicacies such as papadams).
                <br><br>
                Lamprais is a complicated Sri Lankan cuisine that often comprises stock-cooked short-grained rice, three meat curry (beef, pork, and lamb), eggplant pickle, seeni sambol (onion relish), meatballs, shrimp paste as well as fried boiled eggs.
                <br><br>

                <h2>Side Dishes</h2>
                <p>A few things about Sri Lankan food can be said with certainty: Sri Lankans thoroughly love spices, they love food that explodes with flavor, and many enjoy deep fried, and very tasty, snacks. Whatever you choose to eat in Sri Lanka, your mouth is going to rejoice with happiness.
                <br><br>
                Sri Lanka, being an island with a tropical climate, coconuts and fish are two of the most influential components of Sri Lankan cuisine. Fish is made into curries, and coconut in some form or another, is a dominant ingredient in cooking.</p>
