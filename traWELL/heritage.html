                <h2>Sigiriya</h2>
                <p>Sigiriya, also known as Sinhagiri, is an ancient rock fortress. It is situated in the northern Matale District of Sri Lanka's Central Province. It is a historically and archaeologically significant site that is highlighted by a massive rock column (approximately 200 meters high).
                <br><br>
                Sigiriya is one of the most well-known tourist destinations in Sri Lanka, and for a good reason! This ancient rock informs tourists about the local about culture while also providing a great perspective of the surrounding countryside and mountains.</p>

                <h2>Temple of the Tooth</h2>
                <p>The Temple of the Tooth, popularly known as the Dalada Maligawa, is a prominent landmark in Kandy. It is centrally placed in Kandy, surrounded by the lake and the commercial district. The Maligawa was formerly the royal palace occupied by the king and his consorts, but following the Kandyan Kingdom's downfall, the palace was converted into a Buddhist shrine housing Buddha's tooth.
                <br><br>
                It is a must visit destination for all travelers. Visitors may see Buddhist rituals, tour the museum, which has various old items, and pay homage to the tooth relic at one of the Buddhist ceremonies conducted on the site. The architectural magnificence and historical significance of the Dalada Maligawa will astound you. The Aluth Maligawa, Audience Hall, and the World Buddhism Museum are all worth seeing.
                <br><br>
                Keep in mind that the Maligawa is a Buddhist shrine and that you will need to wear clothing that covers your shoulders and legs.</p>

                <h2>Dambulla Cave Temple</h2>
                <p>This cave monastery, with its five sanctuaries, has been a sacred pilgrimage site for 22 centuries and is Sri Lanka's biggest and best-preserved cave-temple complex. The Buddhist mural paintings (covering an area of 2,100 sq.m), as well as the 157 sculptures, are particularly noteworthy.
                <br><br>
                The Rangiri Dambulla Cave Temple, located in central Sri Lanka, is a live Buddhist complex based on a series of five cave shrines. Since the 3rd century BCE, these natural caves have been inhabited by forest-dwelling Buddhist monks and have been transformed continuously throughout the historical period into one of the largest and most outstanding Buddhist complexes in the Southern and South Eastern Asian region, showcasing innovative approaches to interior layout and decoration.</p>
