            <h3>HISTORY</h3>
            <img srcset="resources/images/ancient-sigiriya.webp, resources/images/ancient-sigiriya.jpg" alt="Sigiriya">
            <p> On the numerous acres of land at the peak, Sinhalese king Kashyapa I (reigned 477 to 495) built a palace in the shape of a huge lion to safeguard him from his rivals. However, in 495, the king was defeated, and the palace was destroyed.
            <br>
            <br>
            After that, the location quickly became a pilgrimage destination and is now a major tourist destination. Visitors begin their final trek to the top through the open paws of the lion, one of the few surviving complete sections of the palace.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are also 21 apsara rock paintings (celestial singers and dancers). In 1982, UNESCO declared Sigiriya as a World Heritage Site.</p>

            <h3>WHAT TO EXPECT</h3>
            <img srcset="resources/images/sigiriya1.webp, resources/images/sigiriya1.jpg" alt="Sigiriya">
            <p>The iconic rocky outcrop of Sigiriya, rising from the central plains, is undoubtedly Sri Lanka's most stunning sight. Near-vertical walls peak to a flat-topped summit containing the relics of an ancient civilization, said to be the epicenter of Kasyapa's brief reign.
            <br>
            <br>
            Climb Sigiriya, a rock fortress built by King Kasyapa in the fifth century AD. Walk through the entrance, that is framed by the paws of a lion, which is rather fitting given its name, 'the Lion Rock.' View the stunning murals that brought Sigiriya its fame.
            <br>
            <br>
            Climb the steep stairway to view the terraced gardens and cisterns that are still in use. As you go through the tunnels leading to the palace, you will get a sense of time gone by. Once you return to the base of the rock from your climb, you can also visit the Sigiriya Museum, which contains some wonderful artifacts.</p>

            <h3>ANCIENT INFRASTRUCTURE</h3>
            <img srcset="resources/images/sigiriya2.webp, resources/images/sigiriya2.jpg" alt="Sigiriya">
            <p>Sigiriya, also known as Lion Rock or Lion Mountain, is a site in central Sri Lanka that contains the ruins of an ancient fortress built on a spectacular monolithic rock pillar in the late 5th century CE. The rock stands 1,144 feet (349 meters) above sea level and 600 feet (180 meters) over the surrounding plain.
            <br>
            <br>
            The name comes from the fact that the rock was formerly carved into the shape of a lion. Only the huge paws remain at the entrance of the climb up the rock. You can observe Kasyapa's gardens and complex irrigation systems that he installed in his stronghold. The ponds are still full of water (although it is no longer clean), and the remains of his fortress's walls and moats may be seen. The most amazing part of Sigiriya that has gained it international reputation, is the unfading rock paintings that continue to mystify many researchers. Despite being almost a millennium old, the colors and shapes are as vibrant as if they were freshly painted.</p>
